    <h1>Workshops</h1>
    <p>We deliver a series of workshops to schools, services, and professionals both in 
        the UK and Ghana.  These workshops are designed to creatively engage discussion
         on girls and womenâ€™s rights, challenge and influence attitudinal change towards
         gender based violence, raise aspirations, and ambition, and promote confidence
         and self-esteem building. Our workshops can also include some of our girls who
         have been trained as peer educators.
        </p>

        <p>We further run creative learning workshops on the African continent for UK
            primary level students. The workshops are designed to educate and enlighten
            young people about the positive and fascinating side of the African continent.
