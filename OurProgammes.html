    <h1>Our Programmes</h1>
    <p>Personal development is at the heart of 5Girls Project approach, it will involve the entire world 
        of each of our girls, recognizing and developing their knowledge, attitudes, skills, relationships,
         and behavior that can be utilized in and outside of the classroom. This involves thinking processes,
         managing emotions, values, and relationships along with a range of life skills that will assist the 
        girls in coping with the challenges of everyday lives.
    </p>

   <p>Our Programmes take a holistic approach, which has been tailored, to develop girls and young women’s 
    strengths, interests, goals, dreams and challenge them beyond what they believe they can do. We provide
     them the opportunity to find their voices and recognize their strengths and utilize this to create a future 
    they can be proud of.
    </p>

    <p>Girls are required to create a personal development plan, identifying areas of their lives they need to
        address and where they want to progress. The girls then make action points and are supported to move 
       forward positively in different areas of their lives.
