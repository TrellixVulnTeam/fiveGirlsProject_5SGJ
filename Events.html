                        improving their IT knowledge. The girls attend 
                        our  practical IT skills training sessions which 
                        take place straight after their ICT theory lesson, 
                        enabling them to put into practice their newly 
                        acquired knowledge . Their enthusiasm, 
                        determination and drive to complete set tasks

        <p>One of our amazing girls did exceedingly well in her Junior High School 
            examinations. She obtained the equivalent of 7 Aâ€™s! To say we are proud is 
            simply an understatement, not only is she a talented actress she's also 
            passionate about advocating against child trafficking and child marriage.
