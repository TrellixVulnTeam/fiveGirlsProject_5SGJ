        <p>We wanted to close the year with a little "get to know us interview".  It has been an interesting and insightful 5 months as we have had the  opportunity to interview some of our favorite female bosses whom are making major moves!. We thought it would be interesting to let  our girls ask us questions about anything they have always wanted to know about us. The questions were picked at random and we tried our best to  answer them as honestly as possible !. We hope you enjoy reading some interesting facts about  Leeanne, Ida and Tina</p>
        <p><b>What is your favorite dish to cook?</b></p>
        <p><b>Ida: </b>I have two, jerk lobster with mac&cheese and some nice crispy fries. The second one is oxtail and rice with some sweet plantain.</p>
        <p><b>Leeanne:</b>I'm not the greatest cook but I would have to say rice, chicken& salad (minus the plantain, i know plantain lovers are screw facing me right now, never understood why people would eat a fried banana)</p>
        <p><b> Tina:</b>For me it has to be Lasagne !</p>

        <p><b>Ida:</b>Catering Business by Bowe packer. This book  gave me an in depth insight into the food industry. It provides the tools on how to start aswell as expand a food business.</p>
        <p><b>Tina:</b>My most inspiring book I have had the pleasure to read this year was Smart Money Woman  by Arese. The book  highlights the need for women to be more financially savvy and why it’s  essential for us to leverage our skills, experience and networks in order  to be of value in both our careers and businesses.</p>
        <p>Leeanne: I have a few  one being the Richest Man in Babylon which inspired me to buy & invest in land,but if I had to choose only one it would have to be Africa's greatest billionaires written by Chris Bishop.This book gives a deep insight into the entrepreneur journies of some of Africa's giants, how they started , challenges they faced in amassing their wealth which is deeply inspirational to say the least. The bible is also a close favorite of mine , it has transformed me in many ways.</p>
        <p><b>Who is your favorite African Queen and why?</b></p>
        <p>Ida: My favorite African Queen is my mother because she's incredibly resilient and has unshakable faith in God. Witnessing her overcome many obstacles and still remain steadfast has helped me to vehemently pursue my goals regardless of what challenges may come my way.</p>

        <p>Leeanne: Besides my mother, I would have to say my grandmother who was the epitome of grace & resilience. Her heart of gold and fearlessness attitude  is something which I really admired.From what I can remember she only attended school up to grade 7 but she could fix a stove, refrigerator just an all around DIY queen, a skill i would like to think i have inherited ! I agree with Tina too Queen Nzinga was a phenomenal woman.</p>
        <p><b>Would you rather jump out of a plane or spend a night in the jungle?</b></p>
        <p>Tina: Jump of a plane, the adrenaline will be amazing!</p>

        <p>Leeanne: Chale, ordinary flying I can't handle so I would've to agree with Miss Ida spend a night in the jungle with wild animals!</p>
        <p><b>Spend the  night watching Nollywood or Hollywood movies?</b></p>
        <p>Tina: Without a doubt Nollywood, I love anything African</p>

        <p><b>Besides 5girls project what are your other passions?</b></p>
        <p>Tina: Raising awareness of gender based violence and inequality is one of my passions. Additionally,I’ve always been passionate about black history especially the role female leaders had in the development of Africa and the Caribbean. From this, I was inspired to create Affinity Line a brand celebrating African women in history which enables a modern woman to affirm her greatness, inner power and self discovery.</p>
        <p>Ida:  Besides  5 girls project, I'm very passionate about  helping people become  the best version of themselves spiritually, mentally, financially and physically. This has inspired me to start a project (developing you 4 others) which aims to help people view their life experiences/ challenges in a positive light and ultimately reach a stage were they're confident enough to help others learn and grow . I'm also a  huge food enthusiast who incredibly enjoys cooking a wide variety of dishes. I love it when a dish can tell a story!</p>
        <p>Leeanne: Growing up I loved acting , I was involved in many school & church plays. Outside of acting ,I also share a strong passion for writing & hope to publish a few books in the near future. I always say to people "I'm not much of a talker but if you give me a pen & piece of paper I will write you a masterpiece"</p>
        <p><b>What do you want to be remembered for?</b></p>
        <p>Ida: I want to be the person that people remember as always giving hope and never giving up. </p>
        <p>Leeanne:  In the words of Thomas Sankara "I want to be remembered as someone who was useful to humanity" </p>
        <p>Tina: I want to be remembered as an empowered woman, who empowered women !</p>

        <p><b>This month we caught up with a phenomenal writer & media personality all the way from the beautiful land of Ghana, Annabella Ohene Djan!</b></p>

        <div class="blog__img blog__img-2"></div>
        <p><b> Can you give us a brief overview of your profession/ business?</b></p>
        <p>I'm into the business of using words to rekindle the can-do spirit in people and also connect with charity organizations to touch lives. An  inspiration business which seek to make people realize they are destined for greatness, could be the one in their generation and feel their sense of importance.</p>
        <p><b>If you could use only three words to describe yourself what would they be?</b></p>
        <p>I would describe myself as being a  warrior, visionary and positive soul.</p>
        <p><b>What do you enjoy the most about your job/business?</b></p>
        <p>I enjoy going on charitable outreach, writing inspirational and motivational articles which I hope someone can read and be able to draw some inspiration from.</p>
        <p><b>What does female empowerment mean to you?</b></p>
        <p>To me female empowerment  means a female who goes through a lot of stages and phases in life to know her worth and value and then uses it to contribute to the growth of her generation.</p>
        <p><b>Who or what inspires you the most?</b></p>
        <p>I'm inspired most by the phases of life,  particularly how life can toss itself around sometimes. When this happens  you need to be strategic in order to have a root and be a root.</p>
        <p><b>What are some of the hardest challenges you have come across in building your career/ business and how did you overcome them?</b></p>
        <p>When I got to the point where I felt I was pleasing someone and seeking for their approval it led me to open my secret doors which served as a form of distraction. What happened is that, it caused me to lose instruction and instruction is your life.</p>
        <p><b>What  advice would you give to the young girls who are aspiring to  build a career or  business in your field?</b></p>
        <p>I would advice the girls and young women to strive to be of value which I believe will reflect in your business/career. Also, I would encourage them with one of my quotes which says: “ if you are not winning much in your private life, then don’t post too much in your public space. Balance your life in accordance to what you are and what you want.”</p>
        <p><b>Besides working what are some  of the things you enjoy doing during your spare time?</b></p>
        <p>During my spare time, I enjoy watching movies with deep and great content, movies that make me have a serious intra-personal communication with myself. I also have a great interest in radio presenting, which I absolutely love!.</p>

        <p><b>Check out this month's interview with the ambitious and talented Nafatarie Gordon, a highly experienced financial accountant and budding entrepreneur based in the United States. </b></p>
        <div class="blog__img blog__img-3"></div>
        <p><b>Can you give us a brief overview of your profession/ business?</b></p>
        <p>I have worked as a financial staff accountant for the past five years and recently launched my own company, Nafatarie's Imperial Paradise. </p>
        <p><b>If you could use only three words to describe yourself what would they be?</b></p>
        <p>Ambitious, Dedicated & Creative</p>
        <p><b>What do you enjoy the most about your job/business?</b></p>
        <p>I have always enjoyed helping others and through my professional career and business I am able to do just that. Through my professional work as a financial accountant I'm able to provide financial advice to small business owners enabling them to take their companies to a higher level. With my new business venture, I'm able to offer employment to local village women in Mali whom play an instrumental role in the manufacturing of my skin care product.It gives me great joy to be able to give back to these local women so they can assist their families. </p>
        <p><b>What does female empowerment mean to you?</b></p>
        <p>To me female empowerment is about women being recognized and acknowledged for their achievements, goals and greatness.
        </p>
        <p><b>Who or what inspires you the most?</b></p>
        <p>When it comes to inspiration, my father and husband are my biggest source of inspiration. They're both ambitious entrepreneurs who have a strong work ethic and are incredibly passionate about making a positive impact.</p>
        <p><b>What would you say are your key strengths and how have they helped you in building a successful career/ business?</b></p>
        <p>I believe my ability to maintain a positive attitude and self confidence in my abilities have enabled me to remain focused particularly in challenging situations. </p>

        <p>Like everyone else, I have  encountered some obstacles throughout my business and professional career journies. For example,despite studying diligently I did not receive the results I expected from my ACCA course the first time round. However, I had to maintain a positive attitude and remained persistent until i received my desired result. </p>
        <p><b>What  advice would you give to the young girls who are aspiring to  build a career or  business in your field?</b></p>
        <p>My advice would be, find a mentor particularly one that is already in the field/ industry you're interested in so you can be able to lean on them for guidance and inside knowledge .I would also encourage them to maintain a positive attitude towards learning new skills and acquiring new knowledge. It's important to acquire new knowledge and develop big plans, but execution is key! </p>
        <p><b>Besides working what are some  of the things you enjoy doing during your spare time?</b></p>
        <p>Dancing, cooking different dishes , travelling and spending time with my family is what i live for!</p>

        <h3>Upwards and Onwards : Women making boss moves! (Meet the 5GP team)</h3>
        <div class="blog__img blog__img-4"></div>
        <p><b>This month we had the opportunity to interview  the wonderful Stella Ezeogu, a woman of many talents!. The British-born Nigerian female boss is not only making great strides in the financial sector but she is also running  her own successful social enterprise.</b></p>
        <p><b>Can you give us a brief overview of your profession/ business ?</b></p>
        <p>By day I am a Chartered Certified Accountant, and by night I am a Social Entrepreneur.  I have a strong passion for serving undeserved communities and do this through various businesses and initiatives. Currently, I run an accounting service called Accountstar which provides affordable accounting services to small businesses aswell as hosting financial literacy seminars.Collaboration is something which I highly value and as a result I am a co-founder of a hair brand called Signature Braids. We are the first black owned synthetic hair brand, who provide hair that has been treated to reduce the harmful effect of chemicals found in most brands on the market.In addition to this, I also act as an advisor  to government departments on their recruitment and retention strategies to enabling them to maintain a more diverse workforce. I do this through a social enterprise called EmPact, which I co-founded.</p>
        <p><b>If you could use only three words to describe yourself what would they be ?</b></p>
        <p>God-fearing, Driven and Resilient</p>
        <p><b>What do you enjoy the most about your job/business ?</b></p>
        <p>I enjoy giving back and seeing others succeed/excel. </p>
        <p><b>What does female empowerment mean to you ?</b></p>
        <p>To me female empowerment is  about encouraging women to be the best version of themselves ,accomplish their goals regardless of obstacles they may face.</p>
        <p><b>Who or what inspires you the most ?</b></p>
        <p>When it comes to inspiration, I would have to say that my father has been a big inspiration in my life. Coming from a Nigerian background there’s an old school cultural connotation that women should be limited only to certain roles/responsibilities. However, my father was the complete opposite!. His key message which he engraved in me was that you can do anything if you work hard and persevere you can achieve anything, which has stuck with me throughout. My father's work ethic and everything he achieved throughout his life, is something which inspires me everyday.  </p>
        <p><b>What would you say are your key strengths and how have they helped you in building a successful career/ business?</b></p>
        <p>My key strengths would be my faith and my ability to be persistent. When working towards your goals, giving up is much easier than pushing through. However, when you have faith and firmly believe in what you are doing you will see yourself achieving and going beyond what you thought was impossible. My faith in God has helped me to rationalize things when they have not gone according  to ‘my’ plan. I strongly believe that there is always something working for your good even if you do not see it at the time. Being persistent is another key strength I have, I will continue to pursue even if doors have been closed.</p>
        <p><b>What are some of the hardest challenges you have come across in building your career/ business and how did you overcome them?</b></p>
        <p>One of the hardest challenges I face is having to constantly prove myself. In workplaces this has often been due to me being a minority, people have sometimes assumed that I am a ‘trainee’ or of a lower grade which is very frustrating! In my accounting business (Accountstar) I have felt that some men have tried to undermine me or are surprised by my knowledge and experience but I overcome this by refusing the negative perceptions to limit me. Another challenge I have faced is when people around me have not supported by vision/businesses. This can be disheartening especially when you always try to support others but with time, I have learnt that not everyone will support you, and that’s okay. When you understand your ‘WHY’ and your purpose you will keeping pushing even if you’re your own cheerleader!</p>
        <p><b>We are living in a world which encourages self-education; can you tell us any skill that you've taught yourself?</b></p>
        <p>Public speaking is something that I have taught myself, a few years ago I could not speak in front on 5 people. I am still learning but have made a lot of progress.</p>
        <p><b>What  advice would you give to the young girls who are aspiring to  build a career or  business in your field?</b></p>
        <p>Do it because you enjoy it not because of the financial rewards!. Always think about your ‘why’ and once you are sure that this is what you want to do, be intentional and work hard so you can reach your goals. Be sure to be good at what you do and also having a mentor who can offer you guidance is vital.  </p>
        <p><b>Besides working what are some  of the things you enjoy doing during your spare time?</b></p>
        <p>I love travelling, going to spas and food!!</p>

        <h3>Upwards and Onwards : Women making boss moves! (Meet the 5GP team)</h3>
        <p><b>Can you give us a brief overview of your profession/ business?</b></p>
        <div class="blog__img blog__img-5"></div>
        <p>I’m an Informal & Formal Educator and a radio presenter.I am also known as Ohemaa Speaks which is my brand, a platform where people from around the globe come and collaborate through the means of empowerment and showmanship.In addition to this, I  run a Ladies Ministry/Community Organisation called Ladies in Waiting which aims to Edify, Motivate and Empower Ladies in Waiting (LIW). Our aim is to tackle insecurities, bitterness, abandonment and self-esteem and promote self-worth. Women of our current society find it hard to have a voice, but through LIW there will be a change. I also have a business called Feed your Faith, which is a Christian business which has started with my book called The Epitome of Strength, written by myself. Feed your Faith also has affirmation packages to uplift, encourage and restore their faith.</p>
        <p><b> If you could use only three words to describe yourself what would they be?</b></p>
        <p>Driven, Sincere, Adaptable</p>
        <p><b> What do you enjoy the most about your job/business?</b></p>
        <p>I enjoy meeting new people, hearing their stories and testimonies.</p>
        <p><b> What does female empowerment mean to you?</b></p>
        <p>Female empowerment means helping other women to be the best they can be.</p>
        <p><b> Who or what inspires you the most?</b></p>
        <p>When it comes to inspiration, my community inspires me the most. My community allows me to see the beauty of things within, for example culture, family, love. Even when I encounter challenges in my community, it allows me to focus and evaluate on issues that I myself can make a change or at least create awareness.</p>
        <p><b> What would you say are your key strengths and how have they helped you in building a successful career/ business?</b></p>
        <p>My first key strength is prayer, without prayer I wouldn’t have started or even aligned myself with my purpose. My second key strength is being attentive, being attentive is key as without this strength I personally feel that I would be lost. It's important to be attentive especially when you work with people it has allowed me to accept change and work under pressure. Last but certainly not least, I have gained transferable skills,notably rapport-building and negotiating. As a result, I have been able to keep good business relationships and just other people in general.</p>
        <p><b> What are some of the hardest challenges you have come across in building your career/ business and how did you overcome them?</b></p>
        <p>The hardest challenge I have come across is delegating different tasks within my team. Although, I do not consider myself to be a perfectionist  I do however, expect a person to rise above a challenge and take on a task as their own project. In the past, I have found myself having to constantly remind some members of my team not to become complacent. I was able to overcome this by changing my strategy and who I delegated tasks to. I now ask my team members to do certain small workshops or quizzes every so often, so I can see their enthusiasm, but also there may be a few in the team who could have gained more skills. I also make it a priority to pray together  with the team quite often as a way of helping them to address personal challenges they maybe facing outside of work. It is my firm  belief that prayer changes everything.</p>
        <p><b> We are living in a world which encourages self-education; can you tell us any skill that you've taught yourself?</b></p>
        <p>The skill I have taught myself is being  resourceful.</p>
        <p><b>What advice would you give to the young girls who are aspiring to build a career or business in your field?</b></p>
        <p>My advice would be to write everything down and set yourself mini tasks everyday to help accomplish your goal. Protect your goals,ideas and only share with those you can surely trust. Also ,be uncomfortable to be comfortable, explore things that you have not done before and do things that you may have never done, it's definitely a game changer. Last but certainly not least, pray about your business, ask God for direction and pray for humility.</p>
